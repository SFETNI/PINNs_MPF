### Files
main_triple_junction_pyramid.py and main_triple_junction_no_pyramid: These files contains the main code implementation for each scenario

### Save of Weights/Learning
- The simulations are run without no prior learning 
- The pyramidal training concerns only the first time interval $t_0$ - $t_1$ as covered by the related article
-The cumulative learning obtained by the Pyramidal approach is injected to the main simulation "Benchmark_5_triple_junction_16NN_main".. Then this learning
is used for similar configurations (variations of temporal, physical, geomtrical parameters or even the number of phases)..
